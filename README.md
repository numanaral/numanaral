### Hi there 👋
I am a Full Stack ( Developer 💻 | Student 🎓 | Husband 💍 ).  
  
Just got back from my internship, completing my last year at UofC (but still working Full Time).  
Estimate Time Graduation: 2021  

Not fully up to date but [here is my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LJnFmgMGGjY0w8M7fK5Ar6jyuPrv9l-v/view?usp=sharing). I am also hoping to start working on my web-portfolio at [numanaral.tech](numanaral.tech) but you will just be redirected to LinkedIn for now.

My current interest/focus lies on the following stack:
- node/.NET
- Azure
- MSSQL
- React & Redux
- Material Design 
- ES6 & 7 - webpack & babel
